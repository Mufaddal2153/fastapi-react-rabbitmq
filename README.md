# fastapi-react-rabbitmq

## This POC application is a microservice-based application that uses FastAPI, React, and RabbitMQ.
The backend is divided into four microservices: Gateway, ML, Auth, and Notification. The frontend is a React application that communicates with the Gateway service to interact with the backend. RabbitMQ is used for communication between the microservices. The user can register, verify their email, and upload an image to extract text from it. The extracted text is then sent to the user via email. 

## Backend

The backend consists of four main services:

- **Gateway Service:** This service acts as the entry point for all incoming requests. It routes requests to the appropriate microservices and handles the overall orchestration of the application.
- **ML Service:** The ML service is responsible for processing image data. It uses Keras OCR to extract text from images and communicates with the Gateway Service to receive image data and send back the extracted text.
- **Auth Service:** The Auth service handles user authentication and email verification. It includes functionality for registering users, generating and verifying OTPs, and ensuring email verification.
- **Notification Service:** This service is responsible for sending emails to users. It is triggered when processes are completedÂ .

## Frontend
The frontend is a React-Vite application that communicates with the Gateway service to interact with the backend. The user can register, verify their email, and upload an image to extract text from it. The extracted text is then sent to the user via email.
